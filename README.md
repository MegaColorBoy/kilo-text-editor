# Kilo Text Editor

Hello there!

I'm learning on how to build my own text editor by following this [awesome guide](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html) written by [Antirez](http://antirez.com).

## Motivations
I wanted to sharpen my C skills and learn more about text editors work in general. Maybe, it could help me write my own text editor in any other language for a change.

Besides, based on my programming experience, I do know that you can learn a lot about a programming language when you want to build a project with it.

So, why not?

## Aim
[ ] Document my process about whatever I have learnt while building it.
[ ] Try to rewrite this editor in another language like Python or Rust
[ ] Build a habit to learn technologies using the Project Based Learning approach

Let's hope that I'm able to finish this! :D
